= Springy -- Configure Spring contexts with JRuby

Springy lets you use a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on JRuby to wire up your Spring context.
See {Wiring up Spring with JRuby}[http://www.trampolinesystems.com/weblog/wiring-up-spring-with-jruby]
for an introduction.

== Dependencies

Springy requires {JRuby}[http://jruby.codehaus.org] (>= 1.2.0), {Spring 2.5.x}[http://www.springframework.org].

== Usage

You need to add springy.jar, and jruby-1.3.1.jar to your classpath.
Create your context definition and put it somewhere in your classpath. To actually create the context do:

  import org.springframework.core.io.Resource;
  import springy.context.RuntimeSpringyContext;
  import org.jruby.Ruby;

  // ...
  Resource r = new ClassPathResource("/path/to/context_definition.rb");
  Ruby runtime = Ruby.getNewInstance();

  ApplicationContext ctxt = new RuntimeSpringyContext(runtime, r);

=== Examples

See the test cases src/test, src/test/resources/springy/context.rb and its XML equivalent test/resources/springy/context.xml.

== Building

To build Springy from the source, you need need {Maven}[http://maven.apache.org/].

    % mvn package (maven)

in the toplevel directory.
